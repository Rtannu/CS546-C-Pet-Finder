## What are we?
Pet Finder is a pet adoption application designed to allow users the ability to search for pets to adopt and put their own pets up for adoption.

Built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## How to set up our application
First, navigate to project folder [CS546-C-PET-FINDER] and run 'npm ci' to install the required dependencies for the app.<br>
After that, you should run 'npm run seed' to seed the database with necessary information and test data.

## How to run and use the application
- Start the application by running 'npm run start' (optional for local host).
- Users will first arrive at the home page, the landing page, of the website.
- Any user will be able to search for pets from the homepage. The user must select the type of pet they wish to look for, as well as a city, state, or zip.
- Users that have performed a search will see a list of pets. From there, they can filter the search results down and then select one pet to view details about that pet.
- Authenticated users have privileges non-authorized users do not have:
  - They are able to upload their own pets for adoption.
  - They can keep a list of favorite pets they like on the website.
  - They can ask questions about pets listed on the website, or answer questions other users ask about their own.
